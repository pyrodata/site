Charcoal’s physical structure is highly porous, giving it a large internal surface area.</p><p>In pyrotechnics charcoal is principally used as a fuel and reducing agent. Its most historically and widely important role is as the primary fuel component of black powder (traditional gunpowder), where a typical formulation is roughly 75% charcoal, 15% potassium nitrate, and 10% sulfur by weight. Charcoal properties—such as volatile content, fixed-carbon fraction, ash content, and particle size—strongly influence the combustion characteristics of mixtures: ignition sensitivity, burn rate, flame temperature, gas production, and the amount of light and smoke produced.</p><p>Different wood sources and preparation methods yield charcoals with distinct behaviors. Willow, alder, grapevine, and other softwoods are commonly valued for low ash and favorable volatility for high-performance black powder. Coconut-shell charcoal is harder and produces less volatile content and different burn characteristics. Activated charcoal (highly porous, chemically treated) is distinct and generally less commonly used for standard pyrotechnic fuels because its high surface area and adsorption properties change reactivity and handling characteristics.</p><p>Beyond black powder, charcoal is used in: black match and quickmatch (as the carbonaceous binder/fuel), certain smoke compositions where it contributes to dense, dark smoke, and a variety of ignition and incendiary compositions where a carbon fuel is appropriate. Charcoal particle size (meal powder, coarse grits, powdered forms) and milling method are selected to tune sensitivity and rate of combustion for specific pyrotechnic effects. Ash content and inorganic residues from the charcoal can affect the color, smell, and opacity of combustion products as well as mechanical properties of pressed charges.</p>",

The most commonly encountered form is the pentahydrate (CuSO4·5H2O), a bright blue crystalline solid; the anhydrous salt is white to gray and is readily obtained by driving off the waters of hydration.

Copper(II) sulfate itself can impart a greenish‑blue tint to flames and is sometimes used in ground effects, composition mixes, or as a source of copper ions in formulations where a copper salt is required. Because copper salts tend to produce poor, desaturated blues when burned in typical pyrotechnic flames, strong chlorinated donors and hot, reducing conditions are often employed in conjunction with copper salts to shift and intensify the blue component of the emission spectrum. Copper sulfate is sometimes employed in combination with other additives that modify flame temperature or donate halogens to improve color purity.</p>\n\n<p>Typical pyrotechnic roles and uses of copper sulfate include: as a copper source in color compositions (sparklers, stars, and flash powders where appropriate), in colored smoke mixtures where metal salts are used as a pigment precursor, and in experimental or specialty compositions aimed at blue/green effects. It is not itself an oxidizer in the sense of strong oxygen donors (those roles are usually filled by perchlorates, chlorates, nitrates, etc.), but it supplies the transition metal center responsible for characteristic electronic emission lines in the visible spectrum.</p>\n\n<p>Practical considerations in pyrotechnic use: the hydrated form contains water and must be dried if low moisture content is required; the anhydrous salt is hygroscopic and will readily rehydrate. Copper salts can form a variety of complexes (for example with ammonia or organic ligands) that alter color and solubility, and they react with bases, sulfides and reducing agents to give precipitates or altered copper species, which changes their pyrotechnic behavior. Because copper coloration is highly dependent on flame temperature, oxidizer/fuel balance, and the presence of halogen donors, formulations are typically adjusted empirically to obtain the desired hue and saturation.</p>",

It is a complex, water‑soluble mixture of high‑molecular‑weight polysaccharides, oligosaccharides and glycoproteins.

It is dissolved in water to make binders for coating stars, pellets and other pyrotechnic granules; it helps adhere composition layers to one another and to substrates (e.g., star cores, clay or paper tubing). Gum arabic solutions form relatively flexible, clear films that are less brittle than some starch‑based binders, which reduces cracking and flaking of coatings. Because it is highly soluble and forms smooth, low‑viscosity solutions at modest concentrations, it is convenient for use in thin coatings, wash applications and as a carrier for colorants and additives.</p>\n\n<p>Typical uses in fireworks and pyrotechnic manufacture include: coating compositions for aerial shells and fountains, adhesive slurries for pressed or formed components, sizing and surface finishing of paper and cardboard elements, and as an ingredient in certain emulsion or suspension preparations where water solubility and film formation are required. Compared with cheaper binders (e.g., dextrins), gum arabic is often chosen when a clear, flexible film and good solubility are desired; it is also used where minimal residual odor or taste is important in other industries.</p>\n\n<p>Gum arabic is hygroscopic and forms viscous solutions whose properties vary with concentration and the botanical source. It is not a fuel or oxidizer in pyrotechnic terms but serves as an inert organic binder and processing aid.</p>",

Two commercially common grades used in pyrotechnics and metalworking are a low-magnesium, ductile alloy (approximately 95% Al / 5% Mg) and a high-magnesium, brittle alloy (near 50% Al / 50% Mg). The alloy combines the light weight of magnesium with the corrosion resistance and ease of handling of aluminium; its mechanical properties, brittleness and reactivity vary with magnesium content.</p>\n\n<p>In pyrotechnics, magnalium is used as a metallic fuel and spark-producing ingredient. As a metal powder it burns with an intense white light and can produce bright, lustrous sparks; the alloying changes burn rate, spark size and character relative to pure aluminium or pure magnesium. High-magnesium magnalium grades (brittle, easily powdered) are favored where a bright, hot metallic flame or flash is desired, while low-magnesium grades are used where ductility or machining is required.</p>\n\n<p>Common pyrotechnic applications include sparklers, stars, fountains and other effects where bright white or silvery sparks are required, and as a fuel component in certain flash or burst compositions. Magnalium powders are available in a range of particle sizes and morphologies; coarser particles tend to produce larger, longer-lived sparks, while finer powders burn more quickly and brightly. Because the alloy properties can be tuned by changing the Mg/Al ratio, magnalium is widely used to tailor visual effects in metallic-star and spark compositions.</p>\n\n<p>Magnalium also finds non-pyrotechnic uses in lightweight castings, aircraft and automotive components and in applications demanding a combination of reduced weight and improved strength compared with pure aluminium.</p>",

The combination of strong oxidizing power and relative ease of initiation in small-scale mixtures is why it appears in specialized ignition and smoke formulations rather than in mainstream display-grade firework stars and aerial compositions.</p>",

		"description": "<p>Zinc oxide is an inorganic compound appearing as a fine white powder. It occurs naturally as the mineral zincite and is commonly produced industrially by oxidation of zinc metal or by precipitation from zinc salts. ZnO crystallizes primarily in the hexagonal wurtzite structure (stable at ambient conditions), with a cubic zinc blende form possible under certain conditions.</p>\n\n<p>In pyrotechnics, zinc oxide is used primarily as a white pigment and opacifier, and as an inert filler or heat sink to modify burning characteristics of compositions. Its high refractive index and fine particle size make it effective at scattering light, which can increase the apparent whiteness or brightness of a flame or emitted particulate smoke. ZnO is also employed in some smoke mixtures to produce dense, white smoke and can be included in star and composition formulations to influence hue and brilliance by diluting or moderating more strongly colored components.</p>\n\n<p>Because it is chemically stable under many conditions, zinc oxide is valued where an inert bulking agent is needed to control burn rate, reduce sensitivity, or absorb heat during rapid reactions. It finds additional use as a binder additive or stabilizer in some compositions, and as an ingredient in certain delay or flash powders where its thermal and optical properties are beneficial.</p>",
